# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `account-planner` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

The account read at a version, every line naming the system or document
it came from and the date that value was current, with the questions
nothing answered left standing as unknown. The plan at a version: each
opportunity with the evidence for it and against it, its buyer or the
note that it has none, its size in a confidence band, the order and what
each step depends on the one before it delivering, the assumptions
written as testable statements, the risks and what the plan does about
each, the moves with their owners and dates, and the asks naming who had
to agree. The signed version names both signers and the date. At review,
each plan is scored against what it said when it was signed, and every
decision records who made it, on what evidence, and anyone who
disagreed.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement
`account-planner`, whatever else it does well.
