# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `risk-watcher` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

Per risk: the signal, what raised it, the date, and the account it is
against. The confirmation against the account record, or the
contradiction that closed the run without anybody being told. One
reason, in words, with the evidence lines that support it, each naming
the system it was read from and the date. The severity, the scale
version it was set against, and the date somebody must act by. What the
account owner was told and when they were told it. The readings taken
again against the reason after the plan was delivered, set beside what
the customer was promised. Whether the risk cleared, stayed open or went
up, and a departure written with its reason, what was tried, what it
cost and what the customer said, readable by everyone who works
renewals.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement `risk-watcher`,
whatever else it does well.
