# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `usage-monitor` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

Per reading: the metered thing, the entitlement it is set against, the
periods compared, the system it was read from and the date it was read.
Per account: where use sits against each limit, which teams began using
what and when, which stopped and when, and the direction of travel on
each line. A reading is dated rather than reused, so a run that confirms
an opening or watches a risk turn records a fresh read at today's date
and keeps the earlier one beside it. Anyone auditing a decision can put
the reading next to the agreement and get the same answer.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement `usage-monitor`,
whatever else it does well.
