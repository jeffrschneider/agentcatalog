# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `email-producer` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

Each message at a version, with the proof record naming who was sent a
proof, when it went, and what they said. The audience at a version, with
the count before the consent, opt-out and suppression rules were
applied, the count after, and the rule behind every removal. The
schedule as it was set, including the send-time windows and any wait
between batches. The send record naming the version that went, the time
it fired, and the person who said go. The delivery report, with what was
delivered, what bounced hard, what bounced soft, who complained, who
unsubscribed, and who the sending system suppressed on its own. Anything
it could not verify before the send is recorded as unverified instead of
being left out.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement `email-producer`,
whatever else it does well.
