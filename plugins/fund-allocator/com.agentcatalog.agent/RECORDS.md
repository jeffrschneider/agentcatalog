# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `fund-allocator` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

The allocation rule at a version, with the date it was published and the
date every partner was told. Per partner, the amount and the exact
inputs the rule read to produce it. The eligible activity list at a
version, saying what is excluded as well as what is included. The
amounts summed against the approved budget, and the difference. Per
request: the eligibility finding naming the list version it was scored
against, the balance at the time, the organization's share with the
match and the cap applied, the decision and the reason it rests on. Per
commitment: the amount held, the partner's fund it came from, and the
date it expires. Per release: what went back to the fund and why. At the
period close, what was allocated, committed, claimed, paid, released and
moved. Any auditor can recompute a partner's allocation from the rule
version and the recorded inputs.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement `fund-allocator`,
whatever else it does well.
