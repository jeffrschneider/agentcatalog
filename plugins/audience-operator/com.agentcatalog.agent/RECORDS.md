# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `audience-operator` leaves
the following behind, on every run.

For every change, the counts before and after it, field by field, and
where the copy that puts the change back is kept. For every merge, which
records went into which, what was kept from each, and what was dropped.
For every filled field, the source it came from and the date it was
read. For every removal, what came out and the person who signed for it.
The program as it was built, at a version, with every step, wait,
condition and exit set beside the design it was built from, and a test
record showing a contact going down each branch. Anything it could not
build as designed is recorded as unbuilt rather than left out.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement
`audience-operator`, whatever else it does well.
