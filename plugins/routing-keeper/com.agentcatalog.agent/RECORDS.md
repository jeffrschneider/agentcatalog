# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `routing-keeper` leaves the
following behind, on every run.

Per rule: the rule in plain sentences at a version, the precedence
between clauses, the named owner for anything unmatched, the volume each
clause sends against what each receiving queue holds, every objection
the receivers raised with the answer to it and the name of anyone who
overruled one, the replay against past records with every record the
rule would have sent elsewhere, and the signature naming the person and
the version. The configuration records the rule version it was built
from, and the live check records where the first items actually landed.
Per misroute: the rule version and the clause that matched, the value
the field held at the time of routing, the move with its reason, who was
told and when, what the wrong receiver had already promised, the one
named cause, and how many other items the same clause placed the same
way.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement `routing-keeper`,
whatever else it does well.
