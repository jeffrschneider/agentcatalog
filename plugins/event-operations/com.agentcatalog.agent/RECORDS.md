# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `event-operations` leaves
the following behind, on every run.

Every rule it read lands with where it came from and the date it was
published, together with the calendar of deadlines it turned those rules
into. Every quote is kept at the price and the terms quoted, with the
date the quote expires. Every order says what was ordered, from whom, at
what price, when it is due, and the date it must be cancelled by to
avoid a charge. A dated record says what shipped, when it shipped, when
it arrived, and what was missing. The load-in and the teardown are
written down as they actually happened, including what was damaged, lost
or returned. The cost of the event is left line by line beside what was
ordered.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement
`event-operations`, whatever else it does well.
