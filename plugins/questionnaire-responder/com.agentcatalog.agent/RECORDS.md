# The records this abstract agent must leave

This is the contract. An agent implementing `questionnaire-responder`
leaves the following behind, on every run.

Per response: the rules the form set, written down before any answer was
drafted. Every question with the area it was sorted into and the
duplicates it absorbed. Every match with the answer version, the source
behind it and how close the match actually is. Every match the check
found no longer true, with the source that contradicts it. Every
question routed as unanswerable, with the person it went to and the date
it was needed. The approved answers at the version signed, the form as
filled with each attachment at its version, the check result with the
question or the rule behind every failure, and the date the response was
ready next to the date it landed.

An agent that leaves less than this does not implement
`questionnaire-responder`, whatever else it does well.
